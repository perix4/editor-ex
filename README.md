# EditorEx

Scripting editor for Elixir - proof of concept Electron app.

## Motivation

Elixir is actually great scripting language (better than bash obviously :)), so there was a need to create a simple tool where one could paste the input, do some Elixir commands and get the output. Quick, dirty and efficient.

## Prerequisites

Elixir command available in shell and `npm install`

## Run

```bash
  npm start
```

`Ctrl+Enter` to run the code.

## Dark theme only

Of course.
